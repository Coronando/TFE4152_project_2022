## Todo:
- [x] Make the basic nand gate.
- [ ] Test the main nand gate, see its leakage and power drain at different process corners and transistor sizes.
- - Maybe test an alternate nand gate topologi instead of the basic pull-up pull-down network version.
- [ ] TBD
- [ ] ...
  


## AIM-Spice:
So far in AIM-spice I've done some testing of the basic nand gate. First and foremost I've tried to understand how AIM-Spice works and how we should proceed to work with it.

Please read the AIM-Spice files to see the different ways I've implemented things. 


## HDL:
I have not made the nand gate or latch in HDL yet. I will do this as soon as I have a better understanding of how to use Active HDL and System Verilog.
